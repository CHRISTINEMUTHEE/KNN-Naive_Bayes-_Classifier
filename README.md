# KNN & Naive Bayes Classifier
## KNN Classifier
This part of the project was ment to analyse the factors influencing the survival rate in the Titanic dataset while predicting the survival status of an unseen set of samples
## Naive Bayes Classifier
This classifier uses the Bayes formula of Prior and Posterior probability to calcukate the probability of a mail being a spam or not a spam.
# Description
With the analysis we got to understand the predictors and how significant they are at predicting the survival rate
Both of this classifiers are aimed at giving an accurate yet correct prediction once new yet rrlevant data is fed to the model.
# User Requirements
You need Python and a jupyter notebook.
# Set up Installations
clone this project from:https://github.com/CHRISTINEMUTHEE/KNN-Naive_Bayes-_Classifier.git
